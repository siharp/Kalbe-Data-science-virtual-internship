# Kalbe Data Science Virtual Internship

## Introduction
During this virtual internship, I am serving as a Data Scientist and am currently receiving new projects from both the Inventory team and the Marketing team.
From the Inventory team, I have been tasked with aiding in predicting the sales quantity for the entire range of Kalbe products. The goal of this project is to forecast the estimated quantity of products sold, allowing the Inventory team to manage daily stock inventory adequately. The predictions conducted for this purpose will be on a daily basis.
On the other hand, the Marketing team has requested me to create clusters or customer segments based on various criteria. The objective of this project is to establish distinct customer segments. These customer segments will later be employed by the Marketing team to provide personalized promotions and tailored sales treatments.
